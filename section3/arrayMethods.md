# Array Methods
### 1. `Pop ()` method will remove the last text in the listed items within an array, shortening the length of the array
  * this will return or print a the new array excluding the removed element
  * removal using `Pop ()` method would remove 'lavender' from the value of the array from variable 'flowers' and return the new `var flowers = ['sunflower', 'peony']`
### 2. `Push ()` method will add one or more elements to the end of an array
  * changes the length of the array, but by making it longer
  * think the opposite function of `Pop ()` method
### 3. `Shift()` method removes the first text item listed in the items within an array
  * changes the length, just at the beginning instead of the end
### 4. `Unshift()` method adds one or more element to the array at the beginning
  * changes the legnth of the array
### 5. To summarize:
  * `Pop ()` and `Shift()`
    * remove only one element of the array
    * either beginning or at the end
  * `Push ()` and `Unshift ()`
    * adds one or more elements to the array
    * either at the beginning or the end
