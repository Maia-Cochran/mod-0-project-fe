## Section 1 Reflection

### 1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
- I feel that I ask them somewhere in between waiting too long and asking them too soon.
- Sometimes, I'm too timid to ask questions right away. In these moments, I feel as if I need to have my own approach to the wording of my question "just right" in order to ask the appropriate question for what I am trying to learn. Sometimes, this causes me to waste more time than necessary on specific concepts.
- Other times, I feel that I ask my questions too early, rather than trying to learn the concept/skill on my own before asking the question.
- I often feel that I run into moments where I ask a question and immediately respond with, "Oh, that's what I missed! I've got it now!" I think I could use to wait to hear the entire explanation, so the information sticks better in my brain for the next practice with it.

### 2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
- The data types I learned about in this section are: string, numeric, boolean, concatenation, and interpolation. String data type refers to any series of letters, numbers, or symbols that are together within quotation marks. Numeric data types refer to any integer data, which do not use quotation marks. Boolean data types are algebraic in nature, and they are almost always "true" or "false" answering.

### 3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
``` JavaScript
var introduction = "Hello World!";
console.log(introduction);
```

### 4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
- Comments in code are written either with two backslashes // like this or with a backslash and an asterisks on either side of the comment /* like this */
- The purpose of a code comment is primarily to indicate further commentary that is needed to make the code as easy to read for other developers as possible, but they can also be used when there are parts of our codes that we want to intentionally prevent from running for one reason or another.

### 5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
- A variable it a piece of code that we can manipulate to input different values to a piece of code or assign different inputs to a piece of code. This works to make coding/web developing much simpler and more efficient when there are repetitive points that are necessary to build a specific part of a longer code.

- I would explain this to a five year old simply as a piece of something else that can be changed, without changing the entirety of the bigger picture. For example, the best way to explain this to a child is that variables are like toy boxes. The toy box holds an amount of toys, and that amount can be whatever we want it to be (a value). No matter what that value is, the toy box represents that amount of toy which can change (like a variable).

### 6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
- Amazon is a website I use often, and variables used would probably be facets such as search engine verbiage, payment information, quantity of the product desired, membership subscriptions, etc.
- In this case, the words used in the search engine will likely hold a string data type, similar to the payment/billing information portion of checkout. However, the membership subscription verification will likely use a bollean data type (verifying yes/no, true/false if the membership exists and is active). Additionally, the quantity of the product desired will most likely hold a strictly numeric data type.

### 7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
- Concatenation is a programming term used to describe joining strings together within JavaScript. It can be used to join together particular values utilizing several variables in order to create full sentences and interactions with the user of a particular website, app, etc.

### 8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
- A perfect example of an app/website that I think the developers used concatenation would be the Target app. Anytime you login to the app, you can see where the top of the page is greeting the user with their personalized name (something that was inputted when the user created their profile within the app). For example, it says "Hello, Maia!" -- the user's first name being the variable's value in this case. I would be willing to guess that this would also apply to "recently purchased items" portions of the user interface as well as "purchase again?" -- where the developers would simply pull a log from some sort of link from a previously confirmed purchase that itemizes the last shopping purchase you made within the site.

### 9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
- Are concatenations and interpolations data types, or are they terms that are separate from data types? If so, what is different between the two?
- Why am I still not able to open Atom independently from the Terminal when commanding it to do so?
